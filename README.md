John Snow
========
Recreation of John Snow's famous 1854 London cholera map. 
Data borrowed from Robin Wilson and converted to WGS84 geojson.

I've also added a field to the cholera death points, showing distance from the infected well, which can be used for interesting visualizations. 
A georeferenced image can also be added from my mapbox account as a basemap in cartodb using gisbill.Snow.
